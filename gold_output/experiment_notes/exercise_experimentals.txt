
A suspension of NaH (2.12 g, 52.9 mmol, 1.20 equiv, 60% in mineral oil) in THF/DMSO (10:1, 150 mL) was cooled to 0 °C followed by the dropwise addition of ethylene glycol (7.40 mL, 132 mmol, 3.00 equiv). The suspension was allowed to warm to room temperature. After 1 h, the mixture was cooled to 0 °C followed by the dropwise addition of tributyl(iodomethyl)stannane (19.0 g, 44.1 mmol, 1.00 equiv). The reaction mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature and heated at 55 °C for 18 h. The reaction was quenched carefully with deionized H2O (30 mL) and phase-separated. The aqueous phase was extracted with MTBE (100 mL × 2). The combined organic phase was washed with deionized H2O (50 mL × 2), brine (50 mL), dried over Na2SO4 and concentrated to dryness. The residue was purified by flash column chromatography (hexanes/EtOAc; v/v = 10/1) to afford 2- ((tributylstannyl)methoxy)ethan-1-ol (M2) as a colorless liquid (11.2 g, 70%).
